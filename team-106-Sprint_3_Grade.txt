Sets of Test Projects (out of 6): 6

Comments on sets of Test Projects: 6 sets provided and can be tested using the system. Reports are good but lack side-by-side comparison as of now.

Comments on Functionality Expectations: "URL: http://ec2-34-210-26-119.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/ (Admin interface: admin@test.com/123456)
UI is clean and nice since Sprint 2. Need to tweak some UI elements (Runs from previous professors sometimes persists (may be a session issue), browser refresh needs to be used for runs to show up after a new run is added, same issue to see runs after login, delete button needed when adding students in Run menu). System requires professor to select input student individually and name: in a class of 20-30 students, the system is not usable; a folder based or metadata-file based solution (e.g. taking a csv file with student names and repos for 30 students as input) needed to tackle this."


Stretches Achieved:
-----------------------------------------------

(1) Stretch (small): employs more than one comparison strategy on demand. Hint: use the strategy pattern., (2) Stretch (bigger): uses more than one comparison strategy and reports the results of each method, (2) Stretch: Performs the comparison against multiple submissions., (2) Stretch: UI is fully functional for stretch expectations.
Stretch (even bigger): uses more than one comparison strategy and computes an overall score using a weighted polynomial function.

Comments: Stretch for MOSS not done/attempted. Other stretches done as per requirement.
